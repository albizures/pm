# Typescript Rules

- Avoid using default exports
- Prefer using named exports
- Avoid using arrow functions when they have a name, like in exports and methods
- Prefer using the function definition syntax
- Prefer types over interfaces
- Always import types using the import type keyword
- Prefer unknown over any

When using Zod
- prefer using safeParse over safe
